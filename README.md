# Genomic Data Analysis in R
## Differential Expression • PCA • Bioconductor • Statistical Foundations

### This repository contains foundational and applied genomic data analysis workflows in R, focused on:

-Differential expression analysis

-Dimensionality reduction

-Bioconductor ecosystem tools

-Statistical reasoning for genomics

-Reproducible R-based bioinformatics workflows

It serves as both:

-A training foundation in genomic data science

-A reproducible template for RNA-seq and expression analysis

-A portfolio demonstration of statistical competency in genomics
